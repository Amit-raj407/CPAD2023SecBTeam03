            recipe: `I have identified Carrots, Salt, and Ice as the edible ingredients from the list.
            I have rejected the 145-day old eggs kept at room temp in a humid climate, 6-day old coconut chutney kept in room temp all this while, and 10-day old bread stored in moisture as these items are not safe for consumption due to their shelf life and storage conditions.
            For a delicious and practical recipe using the chosen edible ingredients, I recommend creating a Carrot Soup. This recipe is easy to make and requires the following ingredients:
            2 tablespoons of butter
            1 onion, diced
            4-5 carrots, peeled and chopped
            2 cloves of garlic, minced
            Salt and pepper to taste
            3 cups of vegetable broth
            1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg
            2 tablespoons of fresh parsley, chopped
            Instructions:
            Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add the butter and onion, and sauté for 5 minutes until the onions become translucent.
            Add the carrots, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook for an additional 5 minutes.
            Pour in the vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10-15 minutes until the carrots are tender.
            Turn off the heat and use an immersion blender (or pour into a blender) to blend the soup until it reaches a smooth consistency.
            Stir in the nutmeg and parsley. Serve warm. Enjoy!`,
