# Recipe Recommendation Cooking App

## Introduction

Welcome to the Recipe Recommendation Cooking App! This cross-platform application is designed for users who want to create delicious meals using the ingredients they have on hand. The app leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and image recognition technology to identify edible ingredients from images provided by the user and then recommends detailed recipes based on these ingredients.

## Features

- **Ingredient Image Recognition**: Users can take a picture of the ingredients they have, and the app will use image recognition to identify edible items while filtering out non-food items like utensils or furniture.

- **Recipe Recommendations**: The app recommends recipes from the internet based on the identified edible ingredients, allowing users to make the most of what they have in their kitchen.

- **Cross-Platform**: Built using React.js, the app is cross-platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users across various devices and operating systems.
